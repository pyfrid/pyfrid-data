#The configuration file for application devices
#
# Description of parameters
# The configuration of a device starts with "---" separator, and is a simple
# set of parameters in the following form
#
# parameter: value
#  
# There are two main configuration parameters, which are enough to configure a device:
# 
# ---
# alias: "device_alias"
# name:  "device_name"

# where "alias" is an internal readonly property defined in the implementation of a device
# and "name" is a device name which is used in the application and visible to a user.
#
# The "active" property is used to include or exclude a device from the application.
#
# The "group" property is used to set a group name which a device belongs to,
# if not given, it is an empty string.
#
# For more information, see the manual.
